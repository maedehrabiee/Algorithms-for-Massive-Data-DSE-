I purchased my copy many years ago, and it is the one cookbook I go to whenever I have a question about food. I love the \\\"About...\\\" sections throughout the book. I have learned so much. I also go to this cookbook when I'm having company, as I know I can rely on the recipes to be a success.\",\n          \"A psychologist builds and uses a time machine to travel 800,000-30 million years into the future. It is made of Ivory, Crystal, and Nickel, with two levers for control. I found his turning the hypocritical Victorian society inside out to be refreshing and made the book a fast page turner. His not using overly technical language was another plus. The future society he described was intruiging and scary in its extremes. The gentle Eloi being taken care of by the slavish Morlocks makes the reader think of other historical eras where the few parasitically lived off the many. Feudalism and Communism come to mind. But, in this world the Eloi send their own on a regular basis to be fed to the canabalistic Morlocks. This book makes the reader think and encourages one to want to read more about both history and other fiction novels. For that alone, it deserves four and a half stars.\",\n          \"I finally took the time (quick read) to read the book that Apocolipse Now was based on. Great book.

            "Louisa May Alcott wrote many books, but \"Little Women\" retains a special place in the heart of American literature. Her warmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and sweet stories of \"Little Women\" come alive.The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel poverty with their mother Marmee; their father is away in the Civil War. Despite having little money, the girls keep their spirits up with writing, gardening, homemade plays, and the occasional romp with wealthier pals. Their pal, \"poor little rich boy\" Laurie, joins in and becomes their adoptive brother, as the girls deal with Meg's first romance, Beth's life-threatening illness, and fears for their father's safety.The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding (if not to the man of her dreams, then to the man she loves). Things rapidly go awry after the wedding, when Laurie admits his true feelings to Jo -- only to be rejected. Distraught, he leaves; Amy also leaves on a trip to Europe with a picky old relative. Despite the deterioration of Beth's health, Jo makes her way into a job as a governess, seeking to put her treasured writing into print -- and finds her destiny as well.There's a clearly autobiographical tone to \"Little Women.\" Not surprising -- the March girls really are like the girls next door. Alcott wrote them with flaws and strengths, and their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster -- have the feeling of authenticity. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- \"scribbling\" down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.Sure, usually classics are hard to read. But \"Little Women\" is mainly daunting because of its length; the actual stories flow nicely and smoothly. Don't think it's just a book for teenage girls, either -- adults and boys can appreciate it as well. There's something for everyone: drama, romance, humor, sad and happy endings alike.Alcott's writing itself is nicely detailed. While certain items are no longer in common use (what IS a charabanc anyway?), Alcott's stories themselves seem very fresh and could easily be seen in a modern home. And as nauseating as \"heartwarming\" stories sometimes are, these definitely qualify. Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.Jo is the quintessential tomboy, and the best character in the book: rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the \"perfect little homemaker\" image, and Beth just avoids being shown as too saintly. Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, but by her teens she's almost as good as Jo.\"Little Women\" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today. Louisa May Alcott's best-known novel is a magnificent achievement.\n",

Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the &quot;perfect little homemaker&quot; image, and Beth just avoids being shown as too saintly. Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, but by her teens she's almost as good as Jo.&quot;Little Women&quot; is one of those rare period novels that is still relevant, funny, and heartbreaking today. Fun, sweet, and a beautiful experience.\n",

            "Louisa May Alcott wrote many books, but \"Little Women\" retains a special place in the heart of American literature. Her warmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and sweet stories of \"Little Women\" come alive.The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel poverty with their mother Marmee; their father is away in the Civil War. Despite having little money, the girls keep their spirits up with writing, gardening, homemade plays, and the occasional romp with wealthier pals. Their pal, \"poor little rich boy\" Laurie, joins in and becomes their adoptive brother, as the girls deal with Meg's first romance, Beth's life-threatening illness, and fears for their father's safety.The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding (if not to the man of her dreams, then to the man she loves). Things rapidly go awry after the wedding, when Laurie admits his true feelings to Jo -- only to be rejected. Distraught, he leaves; Amy also leaves on a trip to Europe with a picky old relative. Despite the deterioration of Beth's health, Jo makes her way into a job as a governess, seeking to put her treasured writing into print -- and finds her destiny as well.There's a clearly autobiographical tone to \"Little Women.\" Not surprising -- the March girls really are like the girls next door. Alcott wrote them with flaws and strengths, and their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster -- have the feeling of authenticity. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- \"scribbling\" down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.Sure, usually classics are hard to read. But \"Little Women\" is mainly daunting because of its length; the actual stories flow nicely and smoothly. Don't think it's just a book for teenage girls, either -- adults and boys can appreciate it as well. There's something for everyone: drama, romance, humor, sad and happy endings alike.Alcott's writing itself is nicely detailed. While certain items are no longer in common use (what IS a charabanc anyway?), Alcott's stories themselves seem very fresh and could easily be seen in a modern home. And as nauseating as \"heartwarming\" stories sometimes are, these definitely qualify. Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded.

Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the \"perfect little homemaker\" image, and Beth just avoids being shown as too saintly. Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, but by her teens she's almost as good as Jo.\"Little Women\" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today. Louisa May Alcott's best-known novel is a magnificent achievement.\n",

            "\"Eleanor of Aquitaine and the Four Kings\" has been an important source book for perhaps the majority of authors who have written about this extraordinary woman during the past six decades. This book may have been the most important component of Amy Ruth Kelly's academic work. She was a Harvard scholar, close to retirement when her magnum opus went to press circa 1950.A careful reading shows that much of Ms. Kelly's text is original in the sense that she was diligent in exploring manuscripts and early histories, borrowing relatively little from her contemporary historians. She pioneered modern Eleanor scholarship.The author was the product of a more genteel age, a fact which her style betrays. It is curiously antique in places, but easy to read and to follow. For example, she introduces the word \"Paraclete\" without explanation: she herself needed no introduction to the school of Peter Abelard. Her book includes a number of dated curiosities: for example she refers to the Turkish port from which Eleanor sailed to Antioch as Satalia, rather than the modern day Antalya.Several modern scholars think Ms. Kelly got the Court of Ladies wrong. I disagree. I believe that she got it partly right. In fact the true nature of Eleanor's Court of Ladies at Poitiers is still the subject of debate. Personally, I believe that the late Claude Marks, the author of \"Pilgrims, heretics, and lovers: A medieval journey\" came close to reasonable truth on this topic.\"Eleanor of Aquitaine and the Four Kings\" is informative. It can still compete with more recent, \"pure\" biographies such as Allison Weir's \"Eleanor of Aquitaine: A Life,\" and Marion Meade's \"Eleanor of Aquitaine: A Biography.\" Modern historians have added many facts to the life and times of Eleanor of Aquitaine since Ms. Kelly published her title a lifetime ago. But she left us a record that feels true to life, entertaining and wise.Robert Fripp, Author of ...\"Power of a Woman. Memoirs of a turbulent life: Eleanor of Aquitaine\"\n",
